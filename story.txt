Once upon a time there was a Hund that loved Apfelkuchen. 
One day, the Hund decided to visit the nearby Biergarten to find the finest crumbs of leftover Apfelkuchen.
The Hund found the Apfelkuchen he was looking for, now he decided to hunt for a first-rate bratwurst.
The bratwurst was very far away, so he drove to it in a Porsche.
On the way, the Hund stopped at a BÃ¤ckerei to grab a quick snack for the journey.
But beside the Backerei was a interesting Schloss with a man standing outside wearing Lederhosen eating Brot.
The Hund wagged his tail and decided to head to the Ratskeller to find even more treats. 
At the Ratskeller, he jumped up onto the counter and ate a doener and drank someones old pilsner.
The hund stayed there a while to listen to Rammstein on the radio.
Eventually, the hum of the Klimaanlage lulled the Hund to sleep.
Once he woke we went down Hauptstrasse to Berlin to find some Klimaanlage.
On the way there, the Hund got distracted by the bakeries again and had a gebaeck.
A man in the Baeckerei invites the Hund for a ride in his BMW to Eltz castle.
To the Hund's annoyance, the man claimed to be Klaus Heissler--an Olympic skii-jumper who spent several years in a goldfish body.
Klaus, eager to impress the Hund, suggested they enter a wettbewerbsfaehig pie-eating contest at the Schloss Eltz Biergarten.
Strapped in matching lederhosen, they set off to win the grand prize: a lifetime supply of bratwurst.
