Once upon a time there was a Hund that loved Apfelkuchen. 
One day, the Hund decided to visit the nearby Biergarten to find the finest crumbs of leftover Apfelkuchen.
The Hund found the Apfelkuchen he was looking for, now he decided to hunt for a first-rate bratwurst.
The bratwurst was very far away, so he drove to it in a Porsche.
On the way, the Hund stopped at a Bäckerei to grab a quick snack for the journey.
But beside the Backerei was a interesting Schloss with a man standing outside wearing Lederhosen eating Brot.
The Hund wagged his tail and decided to head to the Ratskeller to find even more treats. 
At the Ratskeller, he jumped up onto the counter and ate a doener and drank someones old pilsner.
The hund stayed there a while to listen to Rammstein on the radio.
Eventually, the hum of the Klimaanlage lulled the Hund to sleep.
When the Hund woke up, feeling refreshed, he decided it was time to become wettbewerbsfähig and enter the annual Biergarten eating contest, determined to win the golden bratwurst trophy.
